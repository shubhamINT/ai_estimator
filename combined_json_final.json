            "This estimation is quite realistic. It includes explicit research/discovery steps for each major area (email formats, SharePoint, SAP integration, document generation), and nearly every feature shows proper breakdown (task-by-task), e.g., UI/UX prototyping, error handling, prototyping, and metadata extraction. Hidden complexity is acknowledged through error logging, handling various attachment types (.docx, .pdf, .xls, .png), authentication, permission management, edge case logic (manual overrides, fallback logic, duplicates/fuzzy matches, data normalization/cleanup), and integration with multiple external systems. Testing and retries are either included or implicit in breakdowns involving prototyping and logging. Time estimates for many features are realistic and similar in depth to the sample. A small deduction may apply for not always explicitly listing 'testing/debugging/documentation' for each sub-feature, but the coverage and approach indicate high real-world awareness. Realistic branching logic and document processing is present for all the hard spots. Overall, this deserves a high score.",

It consistently includes research and prototyping tasks (e.g., researching email formats, prototyping rule-based detection, research on SharePoint/TrackWise document generation) before diving into development, satisfying the Discovery/Research criteria. The complexity of external systems (SAP data extracts, parsing various attachment types like .docx, .pdf, fuzzy matching for duplicate checks) is explicitly addressed in the sub-tasks. The features are well-broken down, acknowledging necessary branching logic and error logging/handling."

            "This estimation is also highly realistic. Strong evidence of research/spiking for each integration (email API, SAP, SharePoint), environment setup, schema design, and investigations. Nearly every feature is broken down at an implementation level (model, API, UI, validation, error handling). Hidden complexities are called out: error handling, attachment preview/download, document completeness/validity, dynamic UI states for human intervention, edge-case state management, workflow branching for 'Duplicate', 'Not Valid', etc., and SharePoint workflow termination logic. The permutations of input and process branches are well-addressed with task-level separation. However, this estimate at times splits functionality into multiple lists per feature, making traceability across the entire workflow marginally more complex for a solo developer (though detail is high). There is a bit of repetition in workflow steps but nothing indicating underestimation or naivet\u00e9. Possible minor deduction for some optimistic time values at the front-end. Still, meets nearly all best practice checkpoints for estimates of this kind.",
            "This estimation is exceptionally realistic and earns a perfect score. It meticulously addresses all three audit checks. It assigns time for research and setup for complex integrations (e.g., naming MS Graph/Exchange API, researching BAPI/RFC/OData for SAP). Hidden complexity is handled by explicitly detailing tasks like developing rules engines for SOP classification, defining duplicate check algorithms, secure attachment handling, and complex SAP T-code extracts (ZPP_Fg_CUST, MB52, MM03). The breakdown is clear, step-by-step, and reflects real-world integration challenges and human intervention requirements."
